Here are some examples of where Pathagar has been deployed. Here's where you can see Pathagar in action.


## Offline

Pathagar works without an Internet connection.


## OPDS feeds

The [Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS)](http://opds-spec.org/specs/)
allows different publication sources to publish a catalog, allowing a client to
pull publications from any OPDS compatible source. This means that a client can
browse catalogs from multiple Pathagar instances and download publications from
any one of them.


## Rich documentation

Here you can learn more about how to install and deploy Pathagar yourself (coming soon).

* Raspberry Pi
    Look in the `pi` dirctory for notes on how   
    pathagar can be installed on a Raspberry Pi.  
    (This is still a work in progress.)
