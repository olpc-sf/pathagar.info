There are many ways to get Pathagar. Choose the option that’s right for your
deployment.

- [I already have a server with a Linux OS installed.](#ubuntu)
- [I need a low-power device with everything included.](#raspberry-pi)
- [I want to try out Pathagar in a virtual machine.](#virtualbox)
- [I want the Pathagar source code.](https://github.com/pathagarbooks/pathagar)

Setting up Pathagar is the same as setting up any other Django application.
You'll want to install a database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) and a webserver
(Apache, Nginx, etc).


## Ubuntu

If you already have a machine with Ubuntu installed, this choice is for you. If
you are using a distro other than Ubuntu, we’d love your help to include
instructions here.

Follow these automated instructions for setting up Pathagar on [Ubuntu
16.04](https://github.com/alexkleider/phInfo/blob/master/ubuntu.md).


## Raspberry Pi

If you’d like to install Pathagar on the Raspberry Pi, you can
[download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MTF1nfocvWp3gH7dyx4ITbkxbVlIj6Ze)
an image and install it to SD card. This configuration also acts as a WiFi
access point, so you can use the Raspberry Pi as a school server. Once
downloaded, follow the instructions from the [Raspberry
Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md).

This images is created from our step-by-step instructions at [phInfo
repo](https://github.com/alexKleider/phInfo).

We’ve tested this on the Raspberry Pi 3 and the Raspberry Pi Zero W.


## VirtualBox

If you are familiar with VirtualBox, you can [download a pre-configured virtual
machine](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BEsnANYZRepFY-DgpdvZcTfnoM6YrktQ?usp=sharing)
already loaded with Pathagar.
