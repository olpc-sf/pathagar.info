RUN RASPI_CONFIG

Log on as user 'pi' with password 'raspberry'.

Begin by running the raspi-config command::

    raspi-config

The root file system's partition is expanded to use all of the available
SD card capacity.  After this you are given the opportunity to change
many of the configuration settings:
    1. File system expansion (already done.)
    2. Default user is pi, I've been changing the pw to pi::root
    3. Boot into the command line (My preferred default.)
    4. Internationalization:
        Default language: en_us.UTF-8  (change from en_gb.UTF-8)
        Time zone: America, Los_Angeles. (New Pacific)
        Keyboard: generic 105-key seems to work
            English US
            default
            no compose key
            Control-Alt-Backspace to exit Xwindow
    5...7. Left in the default state.
    8. Advanced options:
        A2. Host name: set to rpi1, rpi2, rachel, (you choose.)
        A4. SSH enabled (I believe this is the default.)
        I believe the other options can be ignored.
Once done go ahead and reboot as suggested::

    sudo shutdown -r now
