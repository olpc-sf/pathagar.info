        <p>This is the 'Hello, World' site. It's just a place holder.
        It serves only to check that the infrastructure is working.
        </p>
        <p>If you are seing this then all is well so far. There
        remains only to load the Rachel Content into the
        /var/www/rachel directory, replacing this file in the process.
